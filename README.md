# Regulad's Hotkeys

My personal AutoHotKey setup. Contains many fun and useful shortcuts, and is built to supplement a tool like PowerToys.

## Overview

* Blinders: Use CTRL+ALT+B to hide content on secondary displays. I use it to lock into video games.
* GNOME Terminal: Use CTRL+ALT+T to quickly launch the Windows Terminal the same way you launch the GNOME terminal emulator.
* Assorted Math Symbols: See the AHK file for binds
